    <h2>The Adani Crisis</h2>
    <p>Adani,Adani,Adani.It's all everyone talks about!Here's our spin on it. Feb 13, 2023</p>
    <p><img src="https://img.freepik.com/premium-photo/stock-market-forex-trading-graph-graphic-concept_73426-104.jpg?w=2000" alt="Image"></p>
    <p>As we all know,A few days ago The Adani Group's stock prices fell,and several shareholders,including Gautam 
     Adani himself,who lost half of his net worth.For reference,Adani was worth an estimated $126.4 billion and the third-richest person in the world.
     Now,Adani's net worth has dropped to $56.4 billion on Bloomberg Billionaire Index from $120 billion two weeks ago.
     This was after Hindenburg Research released a report alleging that Adani and his family members have engaged in fraud 
     and 'brazen stock manipulation".However,The Adani Group Released a statement that "Allegations no. 1, 2, 3, 27, 28,
     29, 30, 31, 72,73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 present no new findings and only dredge up allegations (in some
     cases from a decade ago) which have been judicially disproven and have also been disclosed by us to our investors and the regulators."
     </p>
     <h3><i>Hindenburg Exposed</i></h3>
     <p>The US short seller is among dozens of prominent firms that are being investigated by the DoJ (since 2021) for potentially illegal 
     trading tactics. The probe seeks to establish whether short-sellers used illegal trading tactics to drive down stock prices by sharing
     damaging research reports ahead of time. According to several media reports from last year, federal prosecutors have seized hardware, 
     trading records and private communications as the investigation continues.As one post put it, they were not specialists who exposed 
      fraudulent activity - “they themselves were frauds."
     <br><b>How do these allegations benefit Hindenburg anyway?</b><br>

     (Maybe not?)Altruistic motivations aside, the current situation can make Hindenburg money. As the Research company noted in its report,
     it had taken a 'short position'in Adani Group companies through through bonds that trade inside the US and other investments that trade 
     outside India.They secured billions of profits by butchering citizen of India. However, SEBI did not suspend trading in the stock 
     specially qua to the Adani group,allowed short sellers to exploit innocent investors,said Advocate ML Sharma in his Apex Court petition.
